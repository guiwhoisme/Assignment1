 a)
    $ git status
    On branch development
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/development'.

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

         modified:   README.md
 b)
    6 commits have been done to the repository. "git log" gives all previous commits.
 c)
     Wed Sep 27 16:31:42 2017 used: "git log .gitignore"
 d)

 e)
    Git's branch ability is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally just as fast
    There is no need to copy source code directory.
 f)
    git status lets the user know if there is anything that he has changed that hasnt been added to the repository. Git log shows what has been commited.
 g)
    "git log Weapon.h"
 h)
     "git log --grep=file"
 i)
    I)
      Inheritance is when a class has a base class. These classes can share member data and member functions. Usually a has-a-relationship
    II)
      Polymorphism is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.
    III)
      binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse (i.e. private, protected, public).

7)
    Both polymorphism and encapsulation are being used.
      1) Polymorphism: All weapons(i.e. Sword, Axe, etc...) are a child class of class Weapon
      2) Encapsulation: Class Weapon has both a public and protected section.
